# Brain-MRI-Segmentation

The Dataset is available at - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation/data

We have implemented the MAGRes U-net model (see - https://www.x-mol.net/paper/article/1765469628230504448) for predicting the shape of tumors in brain MRI images and compared the results with a standard U-net model.

The trained model is available for download in the Releases section. To run the App, download the trained model and run 'streamlit run App.py' in the terminal.
